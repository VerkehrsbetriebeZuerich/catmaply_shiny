# make sure that you have the corrent R Tools installed.
# as you might need to build some packages from source

# if do not have RTools installed, you can install it with:
# install.packages('installr'); install.Rtools() # not tested on windows
# or download it from here:
# https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
# in any case, make sure that you select the correct version, 
# otherwise the installation will fail.

# Then you'll need devtools
if (!require('devtools'))
  install.packages('devtools')

# Finally install the package
devtools::install_github('yvesmauron/catmaply')
